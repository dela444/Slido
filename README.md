# Slido
This app, developed as one of the projects on my faculty, is a simplified version of the popular Slido app, built with Node.js and Express. This app helps lecturers communicate with the audience creating an interactive and engaging experience.

For a more detailed description:

- It offers three user rolesâ€”admin, hosts, and guests.

- Hosts: Lecturers can create their accounts, host meetings, and share unique meeting codes with audience.

- Admin: Administrators have access to all hosts, meetings, and features. They have full control over hosts' accounts, meetings and all meeting-related activities.

- Guests: Meeting participants simply enter the meeting code on the landing page to join. They can ask and like questions and provide ratings at the end of the meeting.
